Welcome to my website!
My name is Jacob Vider. I recently graduated with a dual degree BA/BA in Physics and Applied Physics from [Clark University](https://www.clarku.edu/) and [Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS)](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/home-eng).
Currently, I'm doing post-bacc research in the University of Arizona's [Steward Observatory](https://www.as.arizona.edu/research) under Dr. Erika Hamden.
